This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

The game is status gathering satire where the player eats rocks in order to gain status. 
Tasty rocks has two main game phases. The first phase is rock collecting. The player clicks a button to receive rocks. The quality of the rocks are at random. 
The player has a limited amount of space in their inventory before they have to go back to their base.
When the player eats rocks they gain status based on the rarity of the rock.
Quests to find certain rocks can help unlock new features.
Statistics page that includes things like best kinds of rocks and how much you've eaten of that type.
NFT
Social media: eventually the player will be able to post their best rocks on social media including instagranite and roktok. As they do they'll get more followers which gives them a multiplier for clout per rock eaten

MyStone
RockBook
Stonr
instagranite
RokTok

If you want to prestige your socials you can get "cancelled" where you lose your followers but make it easier to get new ones because the algorithms love controversy

Farm rocks/grow crystals

User can't identify rocks without education. Sources of education include books, community college, geology class, chemistry, mining school. Identified rocks also makes rocks more valuable. Education can help the use find better rocks and might unlock new regions 

We should track both rocks/minerals eaten and clout separately. When the game starts the only thing available to users is the collect rock button. Once they have a full inventory they go to the eat rocks screen. Then they unlock sharing the rocks they're eating which starts getting them clout
